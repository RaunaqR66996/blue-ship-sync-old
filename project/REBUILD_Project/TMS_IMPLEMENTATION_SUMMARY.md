# TMS Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Core TMS Data Types & DTOs** (`types/tms.ts`)
- `Shipment`, `Piece`, `Stop`, `TrackingEvent` models
- `PlanRequest`, `PlanResult`, `PlacedPiece` for 3D load optimization
- `Quote`, `Label`, `HandshakeConfirm` for TMS workflow
- Complete TypeScript interfaces with proper typing

### 2. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added TMS models: `Shipment`, `Piece`, `Stop`, `TrackingEvent`, `LoadPlan`, `OrderShipment`
- Proper relationships between orders and shipments
- Support for load planning with 3D positioning
- NFC/handshake tracking capabilities

### 3. **API Routes** (All implemented and tested)
- **POST** `/api/shipments/from-orders` - Create shipment from multiple orders
- **GET** `/api/shipments` - List shipments with filtering
- **GET** `/api/shipments/{id}` - Get shipment details
- **POST** `/api/tms/rate` - Get carrier quotes
- **POST** `/api/tms/choose-quote` - Select carrier quote
- **POST** `/api/tms/labels` - Generate shipping labels
- **POST** `/api/handshake/confirm` - NFC pickup/delivery confirmation
- **POST** `/api/tms/load-plan` - 3D load optimization

### 4. **Frontend Components**

- Seamless integration between Orders and TMS

### 6. **3D Load Optimizer**
- Greedy placement algorithm
- Support for multiple orientations and stacking
- Collision detection and violation reporting
- Real-time 3D visualization with piece positioning
- Utilization statistics (weight, volume, cube)
- Warning and violation reporting

### 7. **API Client & Hooks**
- `lib/api/tms.ts` - Complete API client
- `hooks/use-tms.ts` - TanStack Query hooks for all TMS operations
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Query invalidation for real-time updates

## üéØ Key Features

- Support for PARCEL, LTL, FTL, INTERMODAL modes
- Multi-stop and consolidation options
- Automatic piece and stop generation

### Rating & Carrier Selection
- Mock carrier rating (FedEx, UPS, Old Dominion)
- Quote comparison and selection
- Service level and cost tracking

### Label Generation
- Shipping labels, BOL, packing slips
- Multiple formats (PDF, ZPL)
- Download functionality

### NFC Handshake
- Pickup and delivery confirmation
- NFC device tracking
- Status updates and event logging

### 3D Load Optimization
- Equipment types: Trailer 53', 48', Containers 20', 40'
- Piece positioning with x,y,z coordinates
- Orientation support (NORMAL, ROTATED_90, etc.)
- Stacking rules and collision detection
- Utilization reporting

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend
- Next.js API routes with proper error handling
